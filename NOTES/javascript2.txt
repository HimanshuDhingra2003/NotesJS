There are 2 versions of javascript 
  1.es5   2.es6

  Old version of js i.e es5 contains only var for the decclaration of the variable
  New version of js i.e. es6 contains let and const for the decclaration of the variable

Difference between var,let and const
  1.var is function scoped and var can be used in its parent function and it add itself
  to the windows object
  2.let is braces scoped and for example you use for loop and print a loop varible outside the 
    loop then it will not print but using var can also do same and const also behave same like
    let and one of the most important thing is that it can not add itself to the windows object.
